Place your application icons here:

- cpu.ico     Icon for CPUManager.exe (recommended sizes: 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256; 256x256 PNG-compressed inside .ico)
- memory.ico  Icon for MemoryManager.exe (same sizes as above)

Tips:
- Use square images on transparent background.
- If you don't have icons yet, you can keep this folder empty; the workflow will build without icons.
- To verify icons are embedded correctly, after downloading the EXE, right-click -> Properties -> Details.
